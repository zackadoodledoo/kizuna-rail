<p>
    Welcome to Kizuna Rail! This is a fictional scenic railway tour company in Japan that helps travelers book beautiful train journeys through mountains, coastlines, and historic villages. While the company isn't real, the type of work you'll do here is: brownfield development. Unlike building something new from scratch (greenfield), brownfield means working with existing code that someone else wrote. This is what most professional software development actually looks like.
</p>

<h2>Why Brownfield Matters</h2>

<p>
    In real jobs, you'll rarely build everything from the ground up. You'll inherit websites and applications with inconsistencies, unclear decisions, and missing documentation. Learning to read unfamiliar code, identify problems, and make improvements without breaking things is essential.
</p>

<h2>Learning to Learn</h2>

<p>
    The main goal here is helping you become a self-directed learner. Professional developers don't get step-by-step tutorials for every task. You'll need to read documentation, experiment, debug errors, and figure things out on your own. This is how you build judgment and intuition about how systems work, what solutions fit which problems, and why certain approaches succeed while others fail.
</p>

<p>
    This is exactly what makes senior developers valuable right now. They can use AI effectively because they have the experience to guide it, constrain it, catch its mistakes, and redirect it when it goes off track. They know what questions to ask, what answers make sense, and when a suggested solution will create problems. These scenarios are designed to build that expertise. Work through them yourself, struggle with the problems, and develop the skills that will make you effective with AI rather than dependent on it.
</p>

<h2>Using AI as a Learning Tool</h2>

<p>
    Don't use AI to solve these scenarios directly. Use it to learn. When you encounter unfamiliar terms, concepts, or errors, ask AI to explain them. Use it to understand why things work the way they do. The goal is building your knowledge, not just completing tasks.
</p>

<h2>The Scenarios</h2>

<p>
    Each scenario below places you in a realistic work situation at Kizuna Rail. Read the scenario description, explore how the website currently works, and complete the tasks. Work incrementally and test your changes as you go. If you were directed here by an instructor, follow their specific guidance on which scenario(s) to complete:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/scenarios/emergency-handoff">Emergency Handoff</a> - You are taking over maintenance of the Kizuna Rail website from coworker out on leave. Your task is to familiarize yourself with the codebase, identify and fix existing bugs, and implement new features that were requested but never completed.
    </li>
</ul>
